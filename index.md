Hello, I'm Mike.
I build tools for programming interactive robots in human environments.
My research areas of focus are human-robot interaction and robotics engineering.

I hope to create tools that enable non-robotics experts to comfortably discover, create, maintain interactive robot applications that bring values.

Check out my [3min self-introduction video](https://youtu.be/7iiVnq2Le6w) or [blog](./blog).
I graduated from the University of Washington in 2020 where I worked on [social robot programming](./research).
Here's my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/Curriculum Vitae - Michael Jae-Yoon Chung.pdf).
