Hello, I'm Mike.
I build tools for programming interactive robots in human environments.
My research areas of focus are human-robot interaction and robotics engineering.

I hope to create tools that enable non-robotics experts to comfortably discover, create, maintain interactive robot applications that bring values.

Check out my [research](./research), [GitHub](https://github.com/mjyc)/[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mjyc), [CV](assets/pdfs/Curriculum Vitae - Michael Jae-Yoon Chung.pdf), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljaeyoonchung/) profile! I also share robotics news on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mjyc_/).
