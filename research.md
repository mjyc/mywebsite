I graduated from the University of Washington in 2020.
Here is my dissertation, _[Enabling End-Users to Create Real-World Robot Applications through Visual Programming Interfaces and Automation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/PhD Thesis - Michael Jae-Yoon Chung.pdf)_, and the [recorded defense talk](https://youtu.be/pTml6yEIjcw).

My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=avud6aAAAAAJ) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Jae_Yoon_Chung) profiles provides other views of my publications.
I also share my slides on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/mikechung) and research-related videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTGLwpBhWGKpf6R5jdc-dQ) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/mjyc).
