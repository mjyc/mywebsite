# Collaborating with Undergraduate Students as a Graduate Student

<!--
Idea for an interesting pictureS? hmmm money?
 -->

<!-- Over the graduate school years, I was fortunate to meet and collaborate with amazing undergraduate students in University of Washington Computer Science & Engineering department. -->

Although there are great blog posts on this topic of "how to work with undergraduate students" from veterans in the field [1,2], I have my own take on this topic so here I wrote down the progress I came up with from my experience of working with amazing undergraduate student I met over my graduate school years.

Step 1: Identify your goal.

I'm not going to try to convince you to work with; I'm assuming you so skipping why? <!-- Maybe put this in footer -->

Why do you want to work with undergraduate student? Do you need some help on finishing up a portion of your research work? Are you excited about your own research and want to spread your discovers & peers to explore the topic? Were you .

<!-- What ever your goal is, it is helpful to be clear about it so you can set your own expectations and come up with interview and collaboration strategies before start working with a student. stragies can be updated, but I felt both a graduate student and a graduaate seems happier when we start with a plan (even if its a bad one). -->

Make my recommendation here (and explain why):

Personally, I like to set a goal as finding a future collaborator.
Might take sometime but has potential to pay back the most.

<!-- I've had worked with student with a different goal because I need to get something done and it wasn't as fun and didn't feel like made a big impact in long term. -->

- difficult to find a student who has specific skill; they often want to get exposed or do research; but you are not too motivated at after the thing is done. On the other hand, if the goal was finding a collaborator.

Step 1.5: Find a student

My hiring strategy here:

General Criteria:

- Add "Are they passionate? dream of your research?"

Strategy (based on my goal):

I like to work with students in long-term or with green ones or

Once your goal is set; go find your student! I won't be covering finding students; research symposium; undergraduate research night like venue. How to find to varies on your but I higly recommend checking otu Mike Ernst section. I agree with him and sometimes One thing I've learned is that my goal gets compromised by students I could find. Often, I compromised my goals with students' goal.

Btw, where do you find your student also tells a bit about what kind of students they are.

Where to meet student:

- your advisor
- research symposium

Make recommendation here:

- interview strategy & finding student strategy

Step 2: Identify your student's goal.

Most of time, they are interested in getting exposed "robotics" "AI" "Computer vision" etc. Seldom I met student who wanted to explore very specific topic.

What is their real goal? Need something for applying for graduate school, etc.

In the past the most students I met likely there were less . More recently I met students .

<!-- By thinking about such, makes the collaboration much easier and happy with each other, hence long-term relationship & collaboration. -->
<!-- More recently I met students with and students who wants to expand skillsets for industry. -->

By understanding their goals, you can think about whether you want to help them and can be excited about mutual or indivitual goals. There maybe room for improvements but difficult to influence (esp in short term) and it is easier if there is overlapping goal.

<!-- Step 3: Prepare to work with a

- research credit; fund, etc. for

Most of times, students are have not done independent work; no work experience.

Prepare

Common things to consider are

research journal; issues board;
timeline

Logistics: Could be used for motivating students -->

Step 4: Start collaborating!

- beginning phase -- help them learn basic skills ; most importantly management skills -- something they can only learn at internship.

  - tools; etc.

  - although some of my collegue was ; I recommend not doing, unless you are passionate creating such contents. I tend to leave such to

* all the time -- help them to learn graduate school / research culture

invite them to lab meetings, seminas, etc.
encourage them to engage in conversatons with other students and try to get them involved in research discussions.
Sure they may not be ready to be (but I've been surprised by what students can do) and by getting consistently exposed; they learn something and maybe when they become such skillsets will come out.

How do you know weather they are engaged? Do they want to participate?

How do you know whether they understand something? Observe what they do; it shows up in their code, writing, presentation, etc. the way they express their idea, etc.

- help student to learn how to manage themselve; research journal, issues board, etc.

* final phase -- treat them like a graduate student

<!-- Why collaborate?

Maybe you initially collaborate, etc. -->

Final step: How do you know you have successfully mentored them?

If your student was a researcher--they are naturally collaborating with other student, etc.

If your student was an engineer--have built a system; opensourcing them.

Whatever they are; they are making impact / start doing work without yourhelp. I think that is time to (naturally) move on -- logistically. Peer. have beer at conferences. you know its done.

<!-- Step 5: Push them away from your nest -->

<!-- A human side of me sometimes get jealous of their amazing success, esp., when it seems like they don't seem to acknoledge your help. However,  -->

<!-- While there are great blog posts from

to meet and collaborate with amazing undergraduates.

While there are blog posts from veterans, I have more opinionated suggestions for working with ugrad as grad.

Step 1: Identify your goal.

Why do you want to work with ugrad?

Do you need

Do you want to get more done

Maybe you were an undergrad and want to spread the gospel.

Step 2: Identify their goal.

When you are interviewing ugrad you met at ugrad research symposium, email, your advisor brought, etc.

I like to use following

1. can express themselve?
   Can you communicate with the student?
   If you cannot communicate, you cannot work with them.

2. is he/she intelligent?

3. do they have skillsets you need?

Sometimes it is not possible to select then

Step 3. Preparing for the student,

Set your expectation.
I like to plan for over year. First year is get to know. most of them disappears. Summer time you can really work together.

Scope the project.

Focus on getting exposed to world of research
