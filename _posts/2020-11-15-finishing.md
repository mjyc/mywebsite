I was working at a graduate student intern at a robotics startup when our son was born.
As much as we were euphoric about our son's arrival, the (financial) reality hit us hard.

#### 1. Ask for help,

Although the computer science department at the University of Washington provided stripen but it was not enough for raise a child.

Family friend (wife), etc.

scholarship, etc.

#### 2. look for runway (be realistic)

time management, etc.

1. no

aggressively find all time

#### 3. Attention management and my daily routine

Is it essential? What's the impact? %50 or less. but select the best/high impact tasks.

2. daily routine

particular skillsets

meditation eating/sleeping

#### 4.

- be with them... when you need to.
- really hard to call this; take time off

#### Closing thoughts

Would not have been possible.
Will I be happy? Is this path right for you? long-term rewards
