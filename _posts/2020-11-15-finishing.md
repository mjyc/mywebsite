I was a graduate student when my son was born.
As much as I was euphoric about my son's arrival, reality hit me hard.
I was not ready.
It was brutal but I pulled through the graduate school and here is s selected list of tricks I've learned from having been a graduate student parent.

## Buying time

Time became one of the scarcest resources.
The first thing I did to buy more time for research was saying "no" to social activities, meetings with no clear goal, not-so-related review requests, side projects, system upgrades, etc. as most parents do.
I decided what activities/projects/commitments to say no to based on my gut feeling.
One big problem with this approach was that I couldn't tell if I missed interesting and important opportunities that are unforeseeable from the day I said "no".
I started to explicitly allocate time for explorations and update my goals/plans frequently to adjust my plans based on findings from the explorations^1.
Doing this became easier as I became more aware of my own work/research velocity, which I gained slowly by rigorously tracking my time usage and goals for each week/month/year.

I still felt like there wasn't enough time for work hence the second thing I tried was securing money, e.g., by asking family members and applying for financial aids available via my department or university.
I did not know about any financial support opportunities but learned about them as time goes on by talking to a few other graduate student parents that I didn't know the existence of prior to becoming a dad.

The final trick I learned was delaying tasks.
Delaying tasks is a great trick because often delayed tasks disappear completely due to priority changes.
In the beginning, I delayed tasks that I was already comfortable delaying, e.g., polishing plots before submitting a paper or renaming variable names in codebase while setting up experiments.
Gradually, I started delaying seemingly more important tasks such as polishing related work section (ess., for the initial submission) or optimizing infrastructure/refactoring codebase to save more time and to verify my important hypothesis early.
The most difficult part was knowing what kind of tasks are okay (or not okay) to delay on sight; sometimes delaying seemingly not-so-important tasks comes back after becoming a much bigger task.
For example, there was a time that I didn't refactor the codebase and a big collaboration happened and team members were bothering me all the time to explain my code.
This sort of event is unlikely to happen so it was right not to delay the refactoring task but I could have spent time on coming up with a better risk mitigation plan, which is still cheap to do.

## Letting go

After trying to buy as much time as possible for about a year, I made the following observations:

1. achieving the last 10~20% takes as much more effort as achieving the first 80~90%
2. re-visiting/working on something always takes much more time than the initial take
3. there is a huge difference between having something finished vs. not

These observations made me want to always shoot for the minimal viable product-level quality.
When I started to practice achieving the only MVP, I've realized knowing "what is the appropriate quality for the current task at hand?" was actually hard.
In the past, because I didn't know evaluation criteria very well, I tend to shoot for the high quality just to be safe, which became a very big task (because of 1.) and made me eventually give up on finishing what I've started (which had consequences 3.).
To address this problem, I spent more time on (1) understanding the evaluation metrics well, and (2) prototyping early to feel the required amount of time to achieve my desired level of quality.

After understanding the evaluation criteria for the MVP, I found using them to efficiently execute something super helpful.
Another trick I used was holding my breath and split once without looking back.

## Managing attention

After missing countless deadlines--even with doing everything I could do (i.e., the tricks mentioned above)--and taking bullets of the consequences, I've realized that the most important resource is my attention, which I only have about 2~4 hours per week, and not necessarily the time.

It's more expensitve because it's also highly dependent on multiple factors such as my health, my environment, my team's health many of which I don't have control of. 

I started to think how to best use this time.
In addition to tricks I mentioned above I

1. identified most likely time of the day that I have best attention
2. set up my tools to moved unimportant tasks such as scheduling, responding things, 
   - for example, use mobile friendly tools to be able to d
3. identify which tasks requires full attention and not.

For example, 

With this setup, 
1. when I face a new problem, I would start breaking down the problem  and when I don't have full attention or whenever I'm not in front of the computer and write down steps

2. then try to solve these problems. This is where the most case 
   - requires mentally exploring number of cases while feeling some of dangers of exploring certain ideas to avoid getting stuck
   - might have solved problems or not

3. execute, if you have concorete solution, you just need to execute

## Closing thoughts

First, 

Haven't achieved reliied big time on my family, e.g. my wife for taking care of 

First, I'm not sure whac t I did was the 11q=

Should you do this?

Not sure if this was worth it.

The time will never come back.
