I was a graduate student when our son was born.
As much as we were euphoric about my son's arrival, reality hit us hard.
We were not ready.
It was brutal but I pulled through the graduate school and here is s selected list of tricks I've learned from having been a graduate student parent experience.

## Buying time

After becoming a dad, time became one of the scarcest resources.
The first thing I did to buy more time for research was saying "no", e.g., to social activities, meetings with no clear goal, not-so-related review requests, side projects, system upgrades, etc.
How did I decide on what activities/projects/commitments to say no to? Initially, it was based on my gut feeling.
One of the major problems with this approach was that I couldn't tell if I missed interesting and important opportunities that are unforeseeable from the day I said "no".
One trick I've learned is explicitly allocating time for exploration and update my goals/plans frequently^1.
Doing this became easier as I became more aware of my own work/research velocity, e.g., by rigorously tracking my time usage and goals for each week, month, and year.

I still felt like there wasn't enough time so the second thing I did was securing money, e.g., by asking family members and applying for financial aids available via my department or university.
I did not know about any financial support opportunities and learned about them by talking to a few other graduate student parents that I didn't know the existence of.

The final thing I did was delaying tasks that can be delayed.
Delaying tasks is great because often delayed tasks disappear completely because priority changes.
Initially, I delayed tasks that I was comfortable delaying, such as polishing plots before submitting a pepr or renaming variable names in codebase while setting up experiments, but gradually, I started delaying seeminly more important tasks such as polishing related work section (ess., for the initial submission) or optimizing infrastructure/refactoring codebase to save more time and to verify my important hypothesis early.

The most difficult part was knowing what kind of tasks are okay (or not okay) to delay on sight; sometimes delaying seemingly not-so-important tasks comes back after becoming a much bigger task.
For example, there was a time that I didn't refactor the codebase and a big collaboration happened and team members were bothering me all the time to explain my code.
This sort of event is unlikely to happen so it was right not to delay the refactoring task but I could have spent time on coming up with a better risk mitigation plan, which is still cheap to do.

^1 This trick was somewhat inspired by [GIST Planning](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/gist-planning/) and [Startup Engineering](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/startup/lecture_slides/lecture5-market-wireframing-design.pdf).

## Letting go

<!-- Related to the first and second thoughts. -->
<!-- Being okay with MVP. -->
Like many things, achieving 80~90% state is relatively easy but pushing further requires as much efforts.
Many times, last 20% is only important if the direction of the project is right.
It's hard to practice.
Execute and think about whether that was enough.
<!-- what's seemingly  -->

## Managing attention

After about 6 months of being a dad, I've realized that the most important resource is my attention, which I only have about 2~4 hours per week, and not necessarily the time.
It's more expensitve because it's also highly dependent on multiple factors such as my health, my environment, my team's health many of which I don't have control of. 

I started to think how to best use this time.
In addition to tricks I mentioned above I

1. identified most likely time of the day that I have best attention
2. set up my tools to moved unimportant tasks such as scheduling, responding things, 
   - for example, use mobile friendly tools to be able to d
3. identify which tasks requires full attention and not.

For example, 

With this setup, 
1. when I face a new problem, I would start breaking down the problem  and when I don't have full attention or whenever I'm not in front of the computer and write down steps

2. then try to solve these problems. This is where the most case 
   - requires mentally exploring number of cases while feeling some of dangers of exploring certain ideas to avoid getting stuck
   - might have solved problems or not

3. execute, if you have concorete solution, you just need to execute

## Closing thoughts

First, I'm not sure whac t I did was the 11q=

Should you do this?

Not sure if this was worth it.

The time will never come back.
