I was a graduate student when our son was born.
As much as we were euphoric about my son's arrival, reality hit us hard.
We were not ready.
It was brutal but I pulled through the graduate school--with a lot of supports from everywhere--and here is s selected list of tricks I've learned.

## Buying time

Time became one of the scarcest resouece.
In my expeirence, taking care of kids under 3-4 demands high physical labors
bare minimal, preparing food, cleaning tools, dipiers, incesstant crying, etc.
Gradaute school 
however, I beleive it requires a lot of time.

_"No"_

Bought time by applying to 
Aparently there were financial aids, etc., for people.

## Letting go

<!-- Related to the first and second thoughts. -->
<!-- Being okay with MVP. -->
Like many things, achieving 80~90% state is relatively easy but pushing further requires as much efforts.
Many times, last 20% is only important if the direction of the project is right.
It's hard to practice.
Execute and think about whether that was enough.
<!-- what's seemingly  -->

## Managing attention

I said time becomes expensive earlier but really attention becomes really expensive.

Only 2~4 hours.

## Closing thoughts

Should you do this?

Not sure if this was worth it.

The time will never come back.
