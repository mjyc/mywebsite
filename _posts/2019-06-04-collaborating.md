# Collaborating with Undergraduate Students as a Graduate Student in Research

Although there are great blog posts on this topic of "how to work with undergraduate students" from veterans in the field [[1](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/undergrad-research.html),[2](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/)], I have my own take on this topic so here I wrote down the progress I came up with from my experience of working with amazing undergraduate student I met over my graduate school years.

#### Step 1: Identify your goal.

First, you should clearly understand what do _you_ want to get out by working with undergraduate students.
Do you need some help on finishing up a small portion of your research project?
Are you excited about your research topic and do you want to have someone else take a look at unexplored ideas?
Do you want to accelerate the growth of your field by outreaching to undergraduate students?
Whatever your goal is, you want to be clear about it so you or others, e.g., your advisor, department undergraduate advisor, etc., can help you find suitable students effectively.

Note that goals can be updated over time.
Personally, I like to set my initial goal as getting help on a very concrete and small subset of my project, then update my goal to help the student to become a researcher--if and only if such goal seems mutually beneficial.

#### Step 1.5: Find a student.

The easiest approach is doing nothing.
In the University setting, motivated undergraduate students email your advisor or you directly trying to get involved in the research.
The obvious pro of this approach is you don't need to do anything.
The downside is that you cannot control the timing and sometimes even the project topic, e.g., your advisor may email you to work with a student who comes with their own funding and research topic over the summer.

The second easiest approach is attending "undergraduate research fair" type events hosted by your department or University.
This approach gives you more control in timing and the collaboration project topic but requires you to put some effort on preparing materials for the fair and more importantly, I found meeting a suitable or talented student hit-or-miss.

The final approach is asking around.
If you can elaborate your goal and student qualities you are looking for clearly, your peers or advisors can be greatly helpful in finding a suitable student for you.
Compare to the "attending research fairs" approach, this approach can help you find "the student" you are looking but with a low probability of actually finding one.

I like taking both the first and third approaches.
The downside of both approaches are having no control in the timing but if you have multiple projects running at different stages all the time, you always have a small projects to collaborate with so timing becomes less of an issue than finding a talented, passion-sharing student.

Finding a student require you to have an interview strategy.
For this topic, I highly recommend checking out Michael Ernst's ["Tips for interviewing undergraduates for research"](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/interviewing-undergraduates.html).

#### Step 2: Identify your student's goal.

Understanding your student's goal is as important as understanding your own goal for a health and delightful collaboration relationship.

From my experience, the most common motivation of undergraduate students was getting exposed to the robotics research field.
For the older students who are closer to graduate I met, they were often motivated by expanding their skill sets to be prepared for the companies they want to apply.
I also met students who wanted to publish an academic paper before applying for a graduate school.

I found that it is difficult to identify undergraduate students' internal motivations from interviews alone.
Most students do not fully understand what their own goals or interests are since they have not have much experience with the research field.
Therefore I like to plan the first collaboration project with a student as a "getting to know each other" project.
However, if you don't have time to spend on "getting to know each other" project, e.g., a short term project, there is no other way than relying on your intuition for identifying students' motivations.

#### Step 4: Start collaborating.

Your strategies for collaborating should be dependent on your and your student's goals and the agreed collaboration duration.

Regardless, in general, I focus on observing whether a student can do the following in earlier stages of a collaboration:

- Can they communicate?
- Can they learn?
- Can they apply technical skill sets they claimed to have?
- Do they find research interesting?

I use the following approaches to motivate a student:

- Keep reminding the potential impact of the collaboration project.
- Encourage to use the research project for their graduation requirements, e.g., a project for a project-oriented senior class or senior thesis.
- Encourage to participate in lab meetings, research seminars and discussions with peers.
- Encourage to present their work as much as possible--at their class, lab meetings, or even at local meetups.

How do you know your student is engaged in the collaboration project?
Observe them.
They will demonstrate that they have learned required skill by applying them properly.
They will demonstrate that they are excited about the project by spending time on it over the weekend.

#### Step 5: Say good bye.

Most times, students leave the project in less than six months; some graduate, move on to another lab, or simply stop working on it.
What about when things are going well?
How do you know when to stop collaborating?
Eventually, when to part away with your student will become obvious.
They will naturally work more independently and even start identifying their own agendas and work towards them, e.g., by working with your advisor (or another professor) directly.
In other words, when they became an independent researcher, no more mentoring, now you have a peer.
