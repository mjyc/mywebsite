I don't like [robots that tell jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWlL4KjIP4M).
Humor is a complex concept and I don't think [even we humans don't fully understand how it works](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/funny-how/550910/) so trying to make robots say something funny feels like a futile effort.
I also don't like [robots that dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DuJQL8spY).
The robots are not as agile as we humans and every time I see dancing robots, they look like they don't want to dance but were forced to do it.

But we make them tell jokes and dance [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poh5zSsd1rE&t=3s), [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am1csALyEzE), [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2SDVQCzQoA), [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiTGaacQ7Og), and [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHBcVlqpvZ8&t=1s).
Why?
Do we just like them to entertain us?
I recently read about [this portrait drawing robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_pzgfeESs) and I knew people who built [a drawing robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKx49hjHDGc) but it turns out we humans has been [building similar robots since since 1768](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaquet-Droz_automata#The_draughtsman).
[Disney's imagineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering) have been doing robotics research for eventual entertainment purposes.
Among relatively recent products from robot starts, I found [Anki's Cozmo robot](https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo.html) and [contents involving it](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7r_Rty9HwHdUfq869Ss_tQ) the most amusing.

As a researcher in academia I never considered entertainment as a serious application.
But maybe it's time to pay attention to applications or the potentials of robotics in entertainment.
And to be honest, I do kind of like [UpTown Spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHBcVlqpvZ8&t=5s).

## Updates

- _2020.01.06_ There was (yet another) robot dancing video posted from Boston Dynamics. I was amazed at Boston Dynamics' technical achievement but something still bothered me.
Then I found ["These Dancing Robots Are Not About Dance: waiving goodbye to 2020 and popular exploitations"](https://jessicarajko.medium.com/dancing-robots-are-not-about-dance-waiving-goodbye-to-2020-and-popular-exploitations-of-dance-961f57d3ee4c) by Jessica Rajko; I still haven't digested my take on this article but it helped me better understand why I have a certain attitude towards these joking and dancing robots.
