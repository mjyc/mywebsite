Getting started with robotics is confusing.
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field and people think of many different things when they are trying to learn about it.
For example, by google searching "getting started with robotics" gives me the following top three results:

- [How To Start With Robotics? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw-4K9joFL8)
- [Robotics for Kids (and Adults) â€“ Getting Started and How to Progress](http://robotsforroboticists.com/getting-started-kids-adults/)
- [Getting Started in Robotics - ROBOTS: Your Guide to the World of Robotics](https://robots.ieee.org/learn/getting-started/)

They talk about learning skills related to the fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science.
At first, it just felt overwhelming.
Reading each of them slowly again, they were great tutorials especially because they all shared one great message--"learn by doing projects" ([there was even a book named with a similar spirit!](https://www.amazon.com/Robotics-Project-Based-Approach-Lakshmi-Prayaga-ebook/dp/B00PG922M4)).

I 100% agree with the message, I think people should learn robotics by doing projects.
In fact, I recently shared [my curated list of opensource (and other) robotics projects](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-robotics-projects) for those who are interested in building robots.
Because I'm a programmer by training, one additional suggestion I like to add is "start by working a simulator".
Working with hardware is fun but it can be extremely time-consuming so by working with a simulator first you can feel out the robot and identify potential problems early.
Projects like [MuSHR](https://mushr.io/) and [bobble-bot](https://hackaday.io/project/164992-bobble-bot) are great because they provide robot simulators as well as detailed instructions for building robots.
Here is a list of [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)-based simulators that I've curated in [ROS Development studio](https://rds.theconstructsim.com/r/mchung/), [a cloud service](https://www.theconstructsim.com/rds-ros-development-studio/) that allows you to work on ROS projects in browser.
In a similar spirit, I encourage using a single board computer such as [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) or [NVIDIA Jetson products](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/tutorials) instead of using a microcontroller like [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).
Programming a microcontroller can be fun and it can allow you to develop a solution that is highly tailored to your use case, but for learning purposes, it can become a rabbit hole that prevents you from completing the project you started.
However, if your goal is learning mechanical or electrical engineering my advice (rather opinions) is not for you.

Finally, I believe getting involved with robotics communities is effective for learning.
I found the below list could be good entry points for learning about software-focused robotics
- [github repos with #robotics tag](https://github.com/topics/robotics)
- [ROS discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/)

the list below for learning about electronics-focused robotics
- [sparkfun news](https://www.sparkfun.com/news)
- [adafruit blog posts](https://blog.adafruit.com/)

and the list below for learning about hardware-focused robotics
- [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/)
- [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/)
- [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/)

This may be a bit off topic, but since people relate "robotics" with AI/ML computer science research, it might be fun to skim robotics-related papers in open review papers:

- https://arxiv.org/
- https://openreview.net/
- https://paperswithcode.com/ - this one just curates the papers with code. One tip: remember that not all researchers are great coders/documenters.

I believe now is time to learn about robotics and I hope this blurb can be helpful to aspiring roboticists.
