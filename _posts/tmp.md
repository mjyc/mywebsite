Depiction of robots as human.
When I came to US and watching starwars prequal triology, I'm more convinced that robots are going to be like human.

Then I became roboticists and learned robots aren't what I thought it was -- microcontroller -- after programming such a simple thing for a while, I realized that ... it was a long shot.

Then I thought what would people be or think?

Hey think robots should be super awesome.

I hope the death of these startup should be wake up call.

So what do we do now?

We could wait until amazon's Vespa or ... .

I think every one should build their own robots!

because I want to become a super human like Tony Start but unlike him I don't think I can build my bots my self.

So I want everyone to work on building their assistant robots and share techniques, so we all can be super human at what we do.

Sure it will take a long time to achieve what tony Start built but by having everyone involved, everyone understand what robots are, explore their unique applications themselves, and. -->
